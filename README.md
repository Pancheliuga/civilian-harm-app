The main idea of this project was to present the results of my previous work - [Spatial Data Analysis of Civilian Harm in Ukraine](https://pancheliuga.com/projects/spatial-data-analysis-of-civilian-harm-in-ukraine/), which was made in the Jupyter notebook, to a broad audience.

The web application looks suitable for this case for a few reasons:
- the data used in this analysis is continuous, and instead of launching the Jupyter environment every time, you open an app and retrieve updated results;
- the web app provides an additional interactive tool for data analysis;
- easy to share the results of work with "no-data science" people,

and in general, the web-based application works on a variety of devices on the web browser.

This web app combines different tools for data analysis:
1. Charts & Graphs.
2. Heatmap.
3. Choropleth Map. 
4. Data Grid.
